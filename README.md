##WORK LIST


**WORK LIST**

LOADING TIME
-consider S3 loading (hosted from amazon)
-test jeff’s JS code: data-src

LOADING SCREEN
-could this be the TOC?
-preview of next article?
-showing you where you are and where you’re going?


NAV // REWRITE
-clean up code
-use display:inline;
consider setting up as php?

NAV // CURRENT STATE
-current state to the orange
-little triangle arrow pointing down underneath it?
-consider white/grey something that goes with all the different background color textures


ARROWS
-add slight dropshadow/border (gets lost on bw photos)
-are they prominent enough?


HOBOCODE 
-change hover opacity to hover color (sprite images)
—hover to gif animation?
-consider how hidden/visible design and placement are
-consider using the ‘pulse’ more as seen on /trackings homepage playlist icon


KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
-should there be an icon for keyboard shortcuts?
-current keyboard shortcuts (most likely unknown to the user)
article overview: “o” or “esc”
full screen mode: “f”
arrow keys: <- ->


**ARTICLES**

ARTICLE // OPENING PAGE // CREDIT
-get to hover simultaneously or just get rid of hover..
-why does top text get larger on responsive? (has to do with reveal.js framework specs i think)
-clean up with antialias code or something like that?

ARTICLE // END PAGE
-rethink table of contents, extra step of user
-but still have the space of reflection/know it’s the end of the article
-include details about the author
—photo, paragraph, links IG/site ect
-share buttons?
-comments? 
-load in next article from ajax so it just slides over?

ARTICLE // ARROWS 
-get rid of hover on article credit showing arrow
-maybe just use that arrow as the lead in to the story (getting rid of the vertically centered right arrow)
-maybe this arrow should be more prominent, orange? pulsing?



**HOME**

HOME // SUBSCRIBE OVERLAY- follow button button (works on chris’ not on jeff’s)

HOME // ISSUES
-consider revising horizontal slide for next issues into a vertical (arrow or next issue button bottom)
-right horizontal arrow could link to first article of issue (possibly load through ajax?)

HOME // IMAGE HOVER
-consider hover fade or color for the circle image not the man+image

HOME // TOC
-fix simultaneous hover on pairs
-consider larger text
-making it seem more like a TOC 
-consider hover on pair = change out circle background of mast head image

HOME // HOBOCODE 
-fix 1 big png, should be separate little ones
-users all tried to click on the hobo code preview 
-maybe add a hover that says what the symbol is or means



**TRACKINGS**

TRACKINGS // JOURNALS
-users always want to scroll up to see crops 
-consider placing off to the side?
-on click journal slides up to the center of page to see whole journal 
-fade out gradient? 


TRACKINGS // HOBOCODE
-get rid of open up animation 
-make it feel more tactile
-have map or image slide down 
—over the image or maybe image gets pushed down?
—idea of large table camera panning across it


TRACKINGS // HOBOCODE // RECEPE 
-replace with live type instead of png
-get print/sendto iphone/share to Facebook links working



**PASSAGES**

PASSAGES // VERTICAL SCROLL
-can’t get reveal.js framework to work with my vertical text animation 
-doesn’t work with mouse wheel or swipe
-explanation and stripped down example here
https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/issues/717#issuecomment-28868316

-take out little arrows (up/down)
-gradient transparency?
-add a little dot to the left and right of the last line, animate it up as the page scrolls indicating where to start reading


PASSAGES PULLQUOTES 
-add white drop shadow for image overlay clarity



**WAYFINDING**

WAYFINDING // JOURNAL 
-don’t allow journal to be draggable 
-make it cut in half better
-consider light gradient on end of page


WAYFINDING // EXPAND PANORAMA 
-make panorama close into itself
-rethink shadow box (although this is nice because it loads image externally)
-work on hover + scroll
—ramp up as you move into it (start movement near center of the screen
—-users would default to drag scrolling and not make way to end of image to see scroll
-integrate new arrow as instruction
-start image at more interesting area (maybe center, scroll left or right?)



**PARTINGS**

PARTINGS // VIDEO
-why does does the page loader take so long, waiting on 1 vimeo video?
